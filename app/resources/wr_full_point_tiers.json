He has a few roadblocks in front of him for this season, namely DJax and Pierre Garcon. However, there is a possibility of one of those veterans being cut before the season, or being sat in favor of the explosive rookie."

Extreme speed (a 4.24 at his pro day) combined with Joe Flacco's arm and Marc Trestman's offense could turn into a high yield fantasy situation. We saw Torrey Smith have some very productive seasons in Baltimore, look for Perriman to provide a great late round value."
